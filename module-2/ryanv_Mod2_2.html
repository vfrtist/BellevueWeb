    <h1>Assignment 2.2 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1 - A bunch of introductory information</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        My name is Vincent Ryan. I have completed 1/3rd of the required classes to graduate from this school. I was on
        the Deans List for the last semester.Â 
        <span class="sentence">I finished both courses with a 4.0.</span>
    </p>
    <p>I already have a degree in fashion design, but I originally started as a chemical engineer. When you have a lot
        of interests, it can be hard to nail down precisely what you want to do with your life. Mine sure took a series
        of turns.
    </p>
    <p>I work at Disney, reviewing, updating, and creating the technical instruction packages for our character
        costumes. It's a particular job that requires a large set of skills. It requires textile understanding, a grasp
        of clothing production methods, computer skills, graphic design skills, technical writing proficiency, and
        sewing and fitting knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>I plan to follow in the footsteps of a past coworker who worked in my department and transferred during COVID
        into software while still at Disney. I've always had a knack and interest in efficiency and processes; I love
        the industrial engineering scope of work. This lends itself well to coding, including pattern recognition and
        problem-solving.</p>
